	Abstract={The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA - https://ega-archive.org/) is a resource for long term secure archiving of all types of potentially identifiable genetic, phenotypic, and clinical data resulting from biomedical research projects. Its mission is to foster hosted data reuse, enable reproducibility, and accelerate biomedical and translational research in line with the FAIR principles. Launched in 2008, the EGA has grown quickly, currently archiving over 4,500 studies from nearly one thousand institutions. The EGA operates a distributed data access model in which requests are made to the data controller, not to the EGA, therefore, the submitter keeps control on who has access to the data and under which conditions. Given the size and value of data hosted, the EGA is constantly improving its value chain, that is, how the EGA can contribute to enhancing the value of human health data by facilitating its submission, discovery, access, and distribution, as well as leading the design and implementation of standards and methods necessary to deliver the value chain. The EGA has become a key GA4GH Driver Project, leading multiple development efforts and implementing new standards and tools, and has been appointed as an ELIXIR Core Data Resource.},

This potentially leaves sensitive genetic data exposed, either because the unencrypted data is not removed after analysis, or because the data leaves traces on the permanent storage medium.: We defined a file container specification enabling direct byte-level compatible random access to encrypted genetic data stored in community standards such as SAM/BAM/CRAM/VCF/BCF. By standardizing this format, we show how it can be added as a native file format to genomic libraries, enabling direct analysis of encrypted data without the need to create a decrypted copy.The Crypt4GH specification can be found at: http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/crypt4gh.pdf.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
