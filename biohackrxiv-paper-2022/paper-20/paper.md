# Introduction

The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) [@EGA] (also known as Central EGA - cEGA) is a service for permanent archiving and sharing personally identifiable genetic and phenotypic data resulting from biomedical research projects. The Federated EGA [@FEGA], consisting of the Central and Federated EGA nodes, will be a distributed network of repositories for sharing human -omics data and phenotypes. Each node of the federation is responsible for its own infrastructure and the connection to the Central EGA. Currently, the adoption and deployment of a new federated node is challenging due to the complexity of the project and the diversity of technological solutions used, in order to ensure the secure archiving of the data and the transfer of the information between the nodes.

The goal of this project was to develop an onboarding suite consisting of simple scripts, supplemented by documentation, that would help newcomers to the EGA federation in order understand in depth the main concepts, while enabling them to get involved in the development of the technology as quickly as possible.

At the same time we aimed to identify existing technologies and standards
across FEGA nodes that can be used as a reference to upcoming nodes.

This biohackathon project is a result of a Nordic collaboration under the umbrella of the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration(NeIC)[https://neic.no/] [@NEIC] where we've had three projects over the last 7 years, [Tryggve1](https://neic.no/tryggve1/)
[@Tryggve1], [Tryggve2](https://neic.no/tryggve2/) [@Tryggve2] and now [Heilsa](https://neic.no/heilsa) [@Heilsa]. For this reason the source code and scripts are shared in the same repository as the "Operator dashboard for controlling the NeIC Sensitive Data Archive" (Project 21) from BioHackathon-Europe 2022.

# Results

In order to achieve the project goals, our plan is to focus on the main pipeline, handling the archiving of the data submitted by users to Federated EGA. Specifically, the goal is to create a number of scripts that would lead the user/developer through the process followed from submitting a file to archiving it and making it available for downloading. 

The scripts aimed to provide some clarity on the processes under the hood, including the messaging between (sent via [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)) the services, the records stored in the database as well as the tools used for encrypting and decrypting the data.

The following tasks were accomplished as part of the BioHackathon:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify the roles that could be part of operation of an Federated EGA node, at the same time specify the needs for each role;
\item Identify the technical requirements joining the federation;
\item Develop a software stack containing the main services for testing purposes and document connections between the services;
\end{enumerate}

## Roles Involved in a Federated EGA Node

In order to focus our work during the biohackathon we decided to first identify the roles involved in running a Federated EGA node:

* **Node Representative** - aims to understand what services need to be adjusted for their node so that they can run the federated EGA in their infrastructure;
* **Developer** - needs documentation about the starting points of the code base, in order to start reading, as well as a demo stack of the services;
* **Operator** - requires a technical checklist to see if the node is technically ready to join federated EGA
* **Helpdesk** - wants to see the files a submitter has submitted, in order to be able to assist in the submission process
* **Submitter** - would need to submit data to a Federated EGA node.

Our attention was towards *Developers* and *Submitters* with the starter pack, while the documentation we produced aimed to help *Node Representative* and *Operator* roles.

Given that the *Submitter* role covers a broader spectrum of questions that such a role might have we decided to focus on the encryption of files, which is a requirement for a file to be correctly submitted.

During the hackathon we identified that *Submitters* would require an easy tool that can assist with the files encryption (using Crypt4GH [@crypt4gh]), thus we aimed to identify and document how such a tool could be utilized.

## FEGA Technical Requirements

We summarized the technical requirements for joining the federation in the following table:

Table: Federated EGA Technical Requirements

From the table above the required points are: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,16,17,19.

This information is augumented with technologies utilized by current nodes (as of November 2022): in a fork of the [FEGA-Onboarding documentation](https://ahornos.github.io/FEGA-onboarding/topics/technical-operational/#technical-requirements).

### Encryption

All sensitive data uploaded to a FEGA node need to be encrypted using the Crypt4GH standard. For encrypting, apart from the file itself, all one needs are the following 2 types of keys:

1. The public key used for the encryption which is provided by the FEGA node. One of the available Crypt4GH implementations:

- [Crypt4GH python](https://github.com/EGA-archive/crypt4gh) module or [crypt4gh-gui python](https://github.com/CSCfi/crypt4gh-gui) module wrapper with GUI;
- [crypth4gh go](https://github.com/neicnordic/crypt4gh) implementation or [sdi-cli](https://github.com/NBISweden/sda-cli) go wrapper;
- [crypt4gh-rust](https://github.com/EGA-archive/crypt4gh-rust) Rust implementation;
- [Crypt4GH Java](https://github.com/uio-bmi/crypt4gh) implementation;
- [htslib-crypt4gh](https://github.com/samtools/htslib-crypt4gh) C implementation;
- [Crypt4GH C](https://github.com/silverdaz/crypt4gh) implementation.

2. Optionally a private key created locally by the user 


## Federated EGA Starter Stack

The FEGA Started Stack from: https://github.com/neicnordic/sda-dashboard was developed against the services developed in the Heilsa project, however another similar stack was identified at: [LocalEGA](https://github.com/EGA-archive/LocalEGA) .

During the Elixir Biohackathon 2022 the starter stack was developed further, bugs fixed and tested by members of two nodes (Greece and France) that were new to the Federated EGA workflow.

The bootstrapping script was able to illustrate the communication that happens between cEGA and FEGA node detailing the messages that are being sent between the two RabbitMQ, for example:

- Ingest Message

Message received from Central EGA to start ingestion at a Federated EGA node.

Processed by the the sda-pipeline `ingest` service.

```
{
   "type": "ingest",
   "user":"john.smith@smth.org",
   "filepath":"somedir/encrypted.file.c4gh",
   "encrypted_checksums": [
      { "type": "md5",
      "value": 
      "1a79a4d60de6718e8e5b326e338ae533"},
      { "type": "sha256", 
      "value": 
      "50d858e0985ecc7f60418aaf0cc5ab587f42c2570a884095a9e8ccacd0f6545c"}
   ]
}
```

- Accession ID Message

Each file will receive an accession ID from Central EGA and this is done via a message sent from Central EGA to a Federated EGA node.

Processed by the the sda-pipeline `finalize` service.
```
{
    "type": "accession",
    "user": "john.smith@smth.org",
    "filepath": "somedir/encrypted.file.c4gh",
    "accession_id": "EGAF00000123456",
    "decrypted_checksums": [ 
        { "type": "sha256", 
        "value": 
        "50d858e0985ecc7f60418aaf0cc5ab587f42c2570a884095a9e8ccacd0f6545c" },
        { "type": "md5",
        "value": "1a79a4d60de6718e8e5b326e338ae533" }
    ]
}
```

# Conclusions and Future work

Part of the members that joined our project represented two nodes that were considering joining the federation, and with their help we were able to identify the missing gaps in the technical requirements, documentation and starter stack, and ultimately were able to guide them through the process of submitting files using the starter stack.

By taking into account different roles we were able to identify existing gaps in the way we documented the services developed within the Heilsa project and this was also quite useful for the development team working with the code-base and deployments as they could more easily get feedback from new nodes, that had little knowledge on how the messages and operations of FEGA can be organized.

The outputs of the Technical requirements have been presented to the Federated EGA Operations Committee and the aim is to have them reflected in future versions of the [FEGA-Onboarding](https://ega-archive.github.io/FEGA-onboarding/) documentation.

One of the clear directions is that, given the number of services required to run a FEGA node, we aim to simplify our setup and streamline our code base.
